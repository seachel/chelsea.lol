	<h1 class="head-normal">Hi! I'm Chelsea Corvus (nee Battell)</h1>

	<p>
		I like logic and crafts.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have a master's degree in mathematics and I'm currently working on a PhD in computer science. My <a href="Research.html">research</a> is in the areas of proof theory (studying formal arguments) and formal methods for software engineering (making sure software does what it's supposed to do).
	</p>

	<p>
		I also sew, knit, and crochet. I've worked on a few projects making tools related to defining knitting patterns and checking their correctness. See <a href="http://chelsea.lol/purl-undergrad">here</a> for the project completed for a compilers course during my undergrad, and <a href="http://chelsea.lol/purl">here</a> for a new version I worked on in the early days of my PhD. These projects are unfortunately poorly documented. I hope to fix this soon.

		<span class="hidden">When not thinking about logic and programming languages or engaging in crafty pursuits, I spend time with my cockatiel, <a href="Curry.html"/>Curry</a>.</span>
	</p>

		Other places on the internet with information about me and my work include <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chelseabattell">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chelsea_Battell">ResearchGate</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/seachel">GitHub</a>.
	</p>

	<p class="hidden">
		I also have a <a href="Resources/Resume.pdf">resume</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I made a webpage on the basics of logic programming languages to use for a presentation and reference. It can be found <a href="http://www.chelsea.lol/pwhol">here</a>.
