	<h1 class="head-normal">Hi! I'm Chelsea Battell</h1>

	<img src="Resources/Images/self_main.jpg" alt="Chelsea Battell"/>

	<p>I like logic and crafts. I have a master's degree in mathematics. My <a href="Research.html">research</a> is in the areas of proof theory (studying formal arguments) and formal methods for software engineering (making sure software does what it's supposed to do). I also sew, knit, and crochet. When not thinking about logic and programming languages or engaging in crafty pursuits, I spend time with my cockatiel, <a href="Curry.html"/>Curry</a>.</p>

	<p>Other places on the internet with information about me and my work include <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chelseabattell">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chelsea_Battell">ResearchGate</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/seachel">GitHub</a>. I've started posting on <a href="https://medium.com/@chelsea.battell">Medium</a>. I plan on talking about my experiences learning and building things.</p>

	<p>I also have a <a href="Resources/Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>


	<p>Lately I've been working on learning JavaScript from a book series called <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS</a>. Types are my security blanket (or possibly shield to protect me from the terrible things in the world), but I have decided to try to relax my need for them and practice working with less structure. I have heard it is good to confront one's fears and anxieties...

	<p class="note">NaN !== NaN oh no... == and === are not equivalence relations? are we all in danger?!</p>

	<p>Well anyway, below are some personal projects I've been working on.</p>

	<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

	<h5><a href="https://seachel.github.io/sewing-pattern-pillow/">Pillowcase Pattern Generator</a></h5>

	This is a page that allows you to enter in a number of details about the pillow you desire and generates sewing patterns for both the pillow and a case for it. It's nowhere near complete but feel free to play around with it.

	<h5><a href="https://seachel.github.io/othello/">Othello/Reversi</a></h5>

	<p>To get some practice using web languages I made a page with this game called Othello (sometimes called Reversi) that I liked to play as a child. </p>
