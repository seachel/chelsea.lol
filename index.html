	<h1 class="head-normal">Hi! I'm Chelsea Corvus (nee Battell)</h1>

	<p>
		I like logic and crafts.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have a master's degree in mathematics and I'm currently working on a PhD in computer science. My <a href="Research.html">research</a> is in the areas of proof theory (studying formal arguments) and formal methods for software engineering (making sure software does what it's supposed to do).
	</p>

	<p>
		I also sew, knit, and crochet. My <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lady.corvus/">Instagram</a> shows some of the things I've made.
	</p>

	<h3>Recent work:</h3>

	<p>
		I've worked on a few projects making tools related to defining knitting patterns and checking their correctness. See <a href="http://chelsea.lol/purl-undergrad">here</a> for the project completed for a compilers course during my undergrad and <a href="http://chelsea.lol/purl">here</a> for a new version I worked on in the early days of my PhD.
	</p>

	<p>
		For a linear logic course project I explored encoding the math of knitting in linear logic. I wrote a <a href="Resources/Battell_LinearLogic_Report.pdf">report</a> and gave a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0_yjGq6ZsnkmMmMln8tKK5BtQ#LinearLogic_knittingPresentation">talk</a> (opens in keynote).
	</p>

	<p>
		I also took a course on Information Visualization where I made a tool using D3 that I called <a href="http://chelsea.lol/treehehe">Treehehe</a> for visualization and walk-through of proof trees. I wrote a <a href="Resources/COMP5209_BattellC_report.pdf">report</a> and gave a <a href="Resources/VA_presentation_final.pdf">talk</a> on this work. I hope to expand this tool to provide an interface for building new trees and then writing LaTeX for the tree.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a complement to a seminar I presented, I made a webpage on the basics of logic programming languages to use for the presentation and later reference. It can be found <a href="http://www.chelsea.lol/pwhol">here</a>.
