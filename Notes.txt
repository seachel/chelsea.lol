Sub 1 (Research):

I have an honours bachelor's degree in mathematics from McMaster University and a master's in mathematics from the University of Ottawa. My main areas of interest are proof theory and formal methods for software engineering.

My master's research contributions include contributing a system called Hybrid for proving things about programming languages. I added a new reasoning layer to help with this process. Using a structural induction proof technique over mutually inductive dependent types, I proved some properties of the logic defining this layer. I also defined a generalization of the new logic to prove theorems more concisely. This work is detailed in my thesis, available on ResearchGate and from the University of Ottawa.


Sub 2 (Crafting):



Sub 3 (Curry):

I live with a very precious/vicious cockatiel named Curry (after Haskell Curry). He enjoys millet, cuddles, and long flights around the house.

He's not a big fan of going out in a harness.
