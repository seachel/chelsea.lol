<p>I have an honours BSc in mathematics from McMaster University and a MSc in mathematics from the University of Ottawa. My main areas of interest are proof theory and formal methods for software engineering.</p>

<p>My master's research contributions include contributing a system called Hybrid for proving things about programming languages. I added a new reasoning layer to help with this process. Using a structural induction proof technique over mutually inductive dependent types, I proved some properties of the logic defining this layer. I also defined a generalization of the new logic to prove theorems more concisely. I have a dream to one day find a simple and elegant explanation of my master's research.</p>

<h4>My master's <a href="Resources/Battell_Chelsea_2016_thesis.pdf">thesis</a></h4>

The corresponding Coq code can be found in <a href="Resources/Hsl_Thesis.v">Hsl_Thesis.v</a>. The file <a href="Resources/Hybrid.v">Hybrid.v</a> must be compiled first. Coq V8.5 is used for this work.

<h4>LFMTP <a href="Resources/LFMTP_20160623_paper.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="Resources/LFMTP_20160623_presentation.pdf">presentation</a></h4>

I presented my work at the Logical Frameworks and Metalanguages: Theory and Practice (LFMTP) Workshop affiliated with the Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction (FSCD) conference in Porto, Portugal in June 2016.

<h4>Ottawa Mathematics Conference <a href="Resources/OMC_20160617.pdf">presentation</a></h4>

I presented a (slightly) higher-level explanation of my research area and contributions at the Ottawa Mathematics Conference in Ottawa, Canada in June 2016.


<h4>McGill University Computation and Logic Group <a href="Resources/McGill_20160212.pdf">presentation</a></h4>

I gave a talk at McGill University in Montreal, Canada in February 2016 where I explained the structure of the system that I contributed to, Hybrid, via an analogy to a garden.


<h4>CMS winter meeting <a href="Resources/CMS_20151206_poster.pdf">poster presentation</a></h4>

I presented a poster outlining my work-in-progress at the Canadian Mathematical Society Winter Meeting in Montreal, Canada in December 2015 and won the CMS Student Committee Award.

<h4><a href="Resources/Purl.pdf">Domain Specific Language for Modular Knitting Pattern Definitions: Purl</a></h4>

This project was completed as part of a compilers course during my undergrad.
