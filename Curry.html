<h1 class="head-retro">Official Fanpage of Curry the Cockatiel</h1>

<p>I live with a very precious/vicious cockatiel named Curry (after Haskell Curry). He enjoys millet, cuddles, and long flights around the house.</p>

<p>He's not a big fan of going out in a harness.</p>

<!-- <p>He also gets mad at his reflection sometimes.</p>
