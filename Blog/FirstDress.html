The first garment I ever sewed is the beautiful dress in the picture above. It was an extremely ambitious project at the time. There were many bumps on the journey to finishing it but I am so pleased with how it turned out and that I decided to take on the challenge. Below I'll talk about the techniques used to make the dress. Unfortunately I didn't take progress pictures :( but I'll show the area where the technique was used.

<h3>Lessons</h3>

<p>
After finishing the repairs on my sewing machine (see my post on <a href="SewingMachineRepair.html">repairing a vintage sewing machine</a>), I was eager to learn to sew, but afraid that with all of the work I always had to do as a graduate student that I would fail to carve out the time for a hobby. To give myself a sense of accountability, I signed up for sewing lessons at a local sewing and knitting store, Yarn Fwd and Sew On. If you ever want sewing lessons, Jutta Hof is an incredible and passionate sewing instructor and will give you many neat tips.

One of the classes I took covered ten techniques in six lessons. The first hour of each lesson was a technique or two and the second hour was working on a project for the course, a cover for a throw cushion.

I was going to a formal Christmas party and rather than buying a new dress I decided I would like to try making one. This was two weeks before the party... I had a sewing pattern that looked easy enough (McCall's M6745). It's for a sundress but I figured I could use fancier fabric and make it look a little more formal.
